Preparing, preprocessing, understanding data, feature engineering and modeling are considered a very important steps in machine learning. However, a Data scientist should be very aware about the results of his model and the way how to interpret his results. This lab covers evaluation and model selection methods that you can use to help understand and optimize the performance of your machine learning models.

Objectives :
	1. Understand why accuracy alone can be an inadequate metric for getting a more complete picture of a classifier's performance

	2. Understand the motivation and definition of a variety of important evaluation metrics in machine learning and how to interpret the results of using a given evaluation metric

	3. Optimize a machine learning algorithm using a specific evaluation metric appropriate for a given task
